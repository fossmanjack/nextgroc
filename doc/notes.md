### Bugs

1. btnX doesn't seem to update its function to addStaples
2. Duplicate items are possible if the text is formatted differently

### Implementation list

1. Sort order/options drop-down or modal
2. Add new list and edit list name
3. Pop-up item menu when adding new items
4. Maybe create an "add item" button?  onFocus change btnX to add the item, onBlur change it back
