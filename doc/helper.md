#### Adding Items

Type the name of the item you'd like to add in the input box in the footer.
The item name can include letters, numbers, spaces, and some punctuation.  If
you would like to enter a quantity, include it after a comma, like so:

Whole milk, 1 gal

Then click anywhere on the page to add the item.  If the item already exists
in your library (see below), the existing entry will be added to the list, otherwise
a new entry will be created.

#### Mode

There are two modes: "List" and "Library."  They can be switched between by
using the green button in the footer.

(list) -- switches to "List" mode
(library) -- switches to "Library" mode

List mode is for shopping.  You can click the checkbox to indicate that you
have put a particular item in your shopping cart.  Then, when you have finished
your purchases, click the "sweep" icon in the footer.  All checked items will
be "swept," removed from the working list.

Library mode is for managing your purchased items.  You can easily add or remove a previously-
bought item to the list, or you can automatically add all of your overdue "staple"
items (see below).

#### Item Detail

Click on the item title to expand the item detail entry, where you can see a
variety of information about the item.  You can edit these details by clicking
the "edit" button (edit button).  When you are finished making changes, click
the "commit" button (commit button), or the "cancel" button (cancel button) to
revert these changes.

Also in the item detail pane, you can designate an item as a "staple," meaning
something you frequently buy.  These items can be automatically added to the list
in the "Library" view.

#### Staples

If an item is designated as a "staple," clicking the "Add staples" button (+)
in the library view will automatically add the item to your list if its designated
interval has elapsed.  This interval is (intended to be) based on your purchase
history, or can be manually specified in the Item Detail pane.
